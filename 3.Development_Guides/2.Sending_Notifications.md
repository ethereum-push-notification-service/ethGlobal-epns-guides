# Sending Notifications

Who can Send Notifications?
As per the current design of the protocol, there can be 3 main actors who can send notifications:
1. **Channel Owners**: The owners of a particular channel can send notifications to their subscribers.

3. **Delegate Notification Senders**: Channel owners can allow any particular wallet address to send notifications on behalf of his/her channel. This feature is called delegated notifications and you can read more about it in this section ðŸ‘‰
4. **Notifications To Yourself**: The EPNS Communicator allows any address to send notifications to themselves ðŸ˜ƒ Itâ€™s important to note, however, that the address sends the notification to themselves only.

> **Note:**
> *Sending notifications is a **gasless** transaction and therefore notification senders need not pay any gas fee while sending notifications via the Dapp.*
>
> *Gas Fees are only applicable when on-chain notifications are triggered directly from smart contracts.*


## How to trigger and send notifications

* [EPNS Dapp](https://docs.epns.io/developers/developer-zone/sending-notifications/dapp-serverless-workflow)
* Using EPNS SDK
* [Using Subgraph](https://docs.epns.io/developers/developer-zone/sending-notifications/using-subgraph)
