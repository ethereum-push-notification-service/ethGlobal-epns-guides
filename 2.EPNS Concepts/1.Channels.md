# What are Channels?
Any user who activates themselves as a service on the protocol to send notifications for its users can be considered a Channel.

In other words, any service, i.e., a dapp, protocol, or even a web2 service, that wants to send notifications out to its web3 users can choose to become a channel and establish an adequate communication bridge with its users.

The creation of a channel is just a one-time simple procedure. It must be noted that channel creation only happens on the Ethereum blockchain and one wallet address can only create one channel only the protocol.

> ***Note: Although channel creation only happens on the Ethereum blockchain, the protocol is designed to be chain-agnostic, i.e., channel owners can choose to send notification on any chain of their choice and not just Ethereum network***

A successfully created channel can send notifications to its subscribers, directly tied to their wallet addresses.

Once any user opts in and becomes a subscriber for a channel, he/she shall receive notifications from that channel directly in their inbox.
Users who are not a subscriber of a particular channel, receive notifications from that channel in their spam box.

> ***Opting In or Opting out of a Channel is a completely gasless transaction and requires no fees.***
