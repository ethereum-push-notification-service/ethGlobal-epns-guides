## Showrunners

The showrunners framework is a scaffold that developers can use to build out notifications for their use cases.

Showrunners framework provides the tools and helpers required for constructing the payload and sending the notification using the EPNS infrastructure.

Out-of-the-box showrunners provide the developer with a scheduling engine and libraries and helpers for easy access to blockchain data as well as web2 data sources.

### How to set-up a Hello World Channel using Showrunners?
Hello World channel exists to simply demonstrate how easy it is to send notifications in Web3.

To setup the channel, you will need to do the following steps:

* Ensure that you have [created your own channel](https://docs.epns.io/developers/developer-zone/create-your-notif-channel) and make a ***note of the private key used for the same.***
* Head to `src/sample_showrunners` from the git clone of epns-showrunners-framework-staging which you had done earlier.
* Copy the folder helloWorld and drop it in src/showrunners folder.

> You might notice that the showrunners has already moved to complain about helloWorldKeys.json not containing the correct private key.

```
{
    "PRIVATE_KEY_1": "YOUR_CHANNEL_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE"
}
```

* Simply copy and paste the private key of your channel instead of YOUR_CHANNEL_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE and you should be presented with the following screen.

### What does a Channel Structure looks like inside showrunners?
Each folder inside src/showrunners is treated as their own channel. Showrunners is designed to be a plug and play solution for your channel which means that each of the folders designated filenames are used to add-on various functionalities. You can have a look at all the files that are required to be inside your channel folder and it's structure here.

> Note: For example, we will assume that your are creating a channel called uniswap.

**Mandatory files required inside Channel directory**
At the very least, two files are required to be inside your channel directory:
1. channelChannel.js [.ts]
* For example: uniswapChannel.js | [Check file here](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-showrunners-framework/blob/main/src/sample_showrunners/helloWorld/helloWorldKeys.json)
* This file contains all the logic functions of your channel, it can for instance have a way to poll all opted in users of your channel and based on certain conditions that are met, fire notifications out.

2. channelKeys.json
* For example: uniswapKeys.json | [Check file here](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-showrunners-framework/blob/main/src/sample_showrunners/helloWorld/helloWorldKeys.json)
* This file contains all your private keys that you either belong to the channel you created or have authorized the wallets to send notification on your channel's behalf.


This is a normal json file, sample below:

```
{
    "PRIVATE_KEY_1": "YOUR_CHANNEL_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE",
    "PRIVATE_KEY_2": "YOUR_DELEGATEE_CHANNEL_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE",
    "PRIVATE_KEY_4": "YOUR_DELEGATEE_2_CHANNEL_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE"
}
```

These two files inside your channel folder will ensure that your channel is correctly loaded in showrunners framework but it doesn't do any magic by itself.

Do ensure that your channel is triggering logic points either through cron job or through postman routes, you need ways to trigger that which leads us to the optional files that enables that.

**Optional files inside channel directory**

These files while optional enables certain trigger points for your channel to operate on.
1. channelRoutes.js [.ts]
* For example: uniswapRoutes.js | [Check file here](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-showrunners-framework/blob/main/src/sample_showrunners/helloWorld/helloWorldRoutes.ts)
* This file contains the routes that you will enable to ensure you are able to manually trigger notification or any other logic points in your channelChannel.js [.ts]
You will ideally use the route of this files in postman to trigger logic functions / test them out.
2. channelJobs.js [.ts]
* For example: uniswapJobs.js |  [Check file here](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-showrunners-framework/blob/main/src/sample_showrunners/helloWorld/helloWorldJobs.ts)
* This file contains your cron jobs to trigger logic points in your channelChannel.js [.ts]
The file is based on node-schedule and can handle a wide variety of automated cron jobs to enable sending wide array of notifications based on triggers.

3. channelAWSSNS.js[.ts]
For example: helloWorldAWSSNS.ts | [Check file here](https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-showrunners-framework/blob/main/src/sample_showrunners/helloWorld/helloWorldAWSSNS.ts)
This file contains the webhook helpers and handle the logic points for consuming a webhook.
This file is based on [AWS-SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/?whats-new-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&whats-new-cards.sort-order=desc) and can handle the variety of logics for consuming webhook to enable sending wide array of notifications based on webhook triggers.
