# PUSH-SDK starter kit

This starter-kit is meant to showcase developers on how to use the PUSH SDK packages - 

* [@pushprotocol/restapi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pushprotocol/restapi) Provides access to PUSH backend APIs.
* [@pushprotocol/uiweb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pushprotocol/uiweb) Provides React based components to show Notifications, Spam, SubscribedModal etc for dApps.
* [@pushprotocol/uiembed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pushprotocol/uiembed) Provides vanilla JS sidebar notifications for any  dApp.

* [@pushprotocol/socket](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pushprotocol/socket) Provides a socket client to connect with Push Websockets

### CRA-Typescript
This particular kit is built out using CRA, Typescript. The SDK packages should also work out for React using plain JS.

## Getting started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/push-sdk-starter-kit.git
```

```bash
cd push-sdk-starter-kit
```

```bash
yarn install
```
```bash
yarn start
```

## Dependencies
If your are trying to build out a separate dApp following this starter-kit example, some of the following dependencies are needed for the SDK and any dApp to work.

1. `@pushprotocol/uiweb` has a `peerDependency` on `styled-components`

```bash
yarn add styled-components
```

2. Since its a dApp, the following are the **web3** dependencies that you can install for wallet connection
```bash
 yarn add ethers
```

3. Needed only if you are using [web3-react](https://github.com/Uniswap/web3-react). You are free to use any other React based web3 solution.
```bash
yarn add @web3-react/core @web3-react/injected-connector
```

**But no need to install these if you are using the `starter-kit` itself since we have already installed these for you so that you can focus on how to use the PUSH-SDK packages**
